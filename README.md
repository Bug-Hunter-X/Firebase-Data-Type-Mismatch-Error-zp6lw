This repository contains a sample JavaScript application demonstrating a common Firebase error related to data type mismatches. The application attempts to read data from the Firebase Realtime Database, but encounters an error due to an inconsistency between the expected data type and the actual data type received from the database. The repository also includes a solution to this issue, demonstrating how to implement proper data type handling to prevent the error.
