To solve this issue, always check the data type before using it. You can use JavaScript's typeof operator to check the data type and handle the data accordingly. For example, you can check if the data is a string, a number, or an object before using it in your application. You can also use type guards to enforce stricter type checking in your code. Additionally, ensure that your database structure is consistent and that your client-side code expects the same data types as those stored in the database.
